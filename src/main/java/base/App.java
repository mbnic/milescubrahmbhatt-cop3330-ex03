Exercise 3 - Printing Quotes

Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string.
But sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks themselves by using escape characters.

Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and
author as shown in the example output.

--------Example Output---------
What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

-------Constraints------
Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise.
Use string concatenation instead.
